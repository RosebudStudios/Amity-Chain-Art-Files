- I'm using friendlycosmonaut's depth system, it's the exact code with no changes.
- It works fine in one room, but when I go to the next room, it crashes and says that
  the sprites dont exist. I believe it's crashing because the objects in the depthobject
  aren't present in the next room.
Some other interesting behavior includes:

When I turn off persistence:
- Both On: Crash from First room to Second
- Object Off: Crash from Second to first
- Sorter Off: Invisible
- Both Off: Invisible and crash from second to first

- When I made the objects in the depth object persistent, everything ran fine, but the 
  objects draw themselves in the second room too.
